  <p>A Presentation component that wraps third-party content for use in react.js</p>
  <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
  <p>The <em>react-content-container</em> is a versatile and essential React-based component designed to seamlessly
    integrate third-party content into micro-front-end architectures. It acts as a bridge between your micro-frontend
    applications and external services, allowing you to encapsulate, control, and manage external content within your
    own user interface.</p>
  <h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
  <h3 id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration</h3>
  <p>With the <em>react-content-container</em>, you can easily integrate content from various third-party sources,
    such as widgets, iFrames, or scripts, into your micro-frontend applications. This component abstracts the
    complexities of interacting with external content, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.</p>
  <h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3>
  <p>The <em>react-content-container</em> encapsulates third-party code within a controlled environment, preventing
    it from interfering with your main application. This isolation enhances security, stability, and maintainability,
    reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or conflicts. This is managed by removing unwanted context that violates
    security or can scrape the DOM via unwanted scripts.</p>
  <h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
  <p>This component provides you with the flexibility to customize the appearance and behavior of the embedded
    third-party content. You can apply CSS styles, provide event handlers, and adjust the dimensions to ensure a
    seamless fit within your application&#39;s UI.</p>
  <h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>
  <p>The <em>react-content-container</em> includes robust error handling mechanisms. If the external content fails
    to load or encounters issues, the component can gracefully handle errors, preventing them from affecting your entire
    application. Component renders will &quot;gracefully degrade&quot; to prevent breakage.</p>
  <h2 id="lifecycle-control">Lifecycle Control</h2>
  <p>You have full control over the lifecycle of the third-party content. You can load, unload, or refresh it as needed,
    offering dynamic and up-to-date interactions with external services.</p>
  <h3 id="data-communication">Data Communication</h3>
  <p>The <em>react-content-container</em> supports communication between your micro-frontend and the embedded
    content. You can send and receive data, enabling interactive experiences and data exchange with third-party
    services.</p>
  <h3 id="versioning-and-updates">Versioning and Updates</h3>
  <p>As new versions of third-party content become available, the <em>react-content-container</em> makes it easier
    to manage updates. You can control which version to load, allowing you to stay up-to-date with external dependencies
    while minimizing disruption to your application.</p>
