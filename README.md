# react-content-container

A Presentation component that wraps third-party content for use in react.js

## Description

The *react-content-container* is a versatile and essential React-based component designed to seamlessly integrate third-party content into micro-front-end architectures. It acts as a bridge between your micro-frontend applications and external services, allowing you to encapsulate, control, and manage external content within your own user interface.

## Key Features

### Seamless Integration

With the *react-content-container*, you can easily integrate content from various third-party sources, such as widgets, iFrames, or scripts, into your micro-frontend applications. This component abstracts the complexities of interacting with external content, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.

### Isolation

The *react-content-container* encapsulates third-party code within a controlled environment, preventing it from interfering with your main application.  This isolation enhances security, stability, and maintainability, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or conflicts.  This is managed by removing unwanted context that violates security or can scrape the DOM via unwanted scripts.

### Customization

This component provides you with the flexibility to customize the appearance and behavior of the embedded third-party content. You can apply CSS styles, provide event handlers, and adjust the dimensions to ensure a seamless fit within your application's UI.

### Error Handling

The *react-content-container* includes robust error handling mechanisms. If the external content fails to load or encounters issues, the component can gracefully handle errors, preventing them from affecting your entire application.  Component renders will "gracefully degrade" to prevent breakage.

## Lifecycle Control

You have full control over the lifecycle of the third-party content. You can load, unload, or refresh it as needed, offering dynamic and up-to-date interactions with external services.

### Data Communication

The *react-content-container* supports communication between your micro-frontend and the embedded content. You can send and receive data, enabling interactive experiences and data exchange with third-party services.

### Versioning and Updates

As new versions of third-party content become available, the *react-content-container* makes it easier to manage updates. You can control which version to load, allowing you to stay up-to-date with external dependencies while minimizing disruption to your application.

## Use Cases

### Widgets Integration

Incorporate third-party widgets like social media feeds, chatbots, or calendars seamlessly into your micro-frontend applications.

### Content

Aggregate and display content from various external sources, such as CMS, MFEs or other HTML sources, while maintaining control over the presentation and user experience.
